# PowerShell Gallery Manifest Structure Error - OTP Module v0.1.0

## Problem Description

The OTP module version 0.1.0 was successfully published to PowerShell Gallery but is missing critical information in the "Info" section, specifically:
- **Project Site** link
- **License Info** link

Despite these fields being present in the module manifest (`OTP.psd1`), they are not displayed on the PowerShell Gallery page at: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/otp/0.1.0

## Root Cause

The issue stems from an incorrect structure in the `PrivateData` section of the module manifest. PowerShell Gallery requires gallery-specific metadata to be nested under a `PSData` key within `PrivateData`, but our current manifest has these fields directly under `PrivateData`.

## Current (Incorrect) Code

```powershell
# Current structure in OTP.psd1 (lines 48-52)
PrivateData = @{
    Tags = @('OTP', 'TOTP', 'HOTP', '2FA', 'Authentication', 'Security', 'VibeCoding', 'EducatedPrompting', 'EduProm')
    LicenseUri = 'https://github.com/thorstenbutz/otp/blob/main/LICENSE'
    ProjectUri = 'https://github.com/thorstenbutz/otp'
    ReleaseNotes = 'Initial release of the OTP module.'
}
```

## Required Fix

```powershell
# Corrected structure for PowerShell Gallery compatibility
PrivateData = @{
    PSData = @{
        Tags = @('OTP', 'TOTP', 'HOTP', '2FA', 'Authentication', 'Security', 'VibeCoding', 'EducatedPrompting', 'EduProm')
        LicenseUri = 'https://github.com/thorstenbutz/otp/blob/main/LICENSE'
        ProjectUri = 'https://github.com/thorstenbutz/otp'
        ReleaseNotes = 'Initial release of the OTP module.'
    }
}
```

## Applied Changes to v0.1.1 Manifest

When creating the corrected manifest file (`OTP/0.1.1/OTP.psd1`), the following specific changes were made beyond the structural fix:

### 1. Version Increment
```powershell
# Changed from:
ModuleVersion = '0.1.0'
# To:
ModuleVersion = '0.1.1'
```
**Reason**: PowerShell Gallery versions are immutable. Any change requires a version increment.

### 2. Updated Fix Documentation Date
```powershell
# Header comment updated:
# Fixed on: 12/19/2024 - PSData structure correction
```
**Reason**: Accurate timestamps help track when fixes were applied for maintenance history.

### 3. Enhanced Release Notes
```powershell
# Changed from:
ReleaseNotes = 'Initial release of the OTP module.'
# To:
ReleaseNotes = 'v0.1.1: Fixed PowerShell Gallery manifest structure - Project Site and License Info links now display correctly.'
```
**Reason**: 
- **User Communication**: Users need to understand what changed in this version
- **Professional Presentation**: Clear, descriptive release notes improve module credibility
- **Troubleshooting Aid**: Future maintainers can quickly identify what this version fixed
- **Gallery Display**: Release notes appear on the PowerShell Gallery page, informing users of improvements

### 4. Maintained All Original Functionality
- All functions, aliases, and dependencies remain unchanged
- Same GUID preserved to maintain module identity
- All export declarations kept identical

**Reason**: This is a metadata-only fix that should not impact module functionality or break existing user scripts.

## Technical Details

The PowerShell Gallery specifically looks for metadata fields under `PrivateData.PSData` when populating the Info section of a module's page. The following fields are affected:

- `ProjectUri` → Controls "Project Site" link
- `LicenseUri` → Controls "License Info" link  
- `Tags` → Controls search tags and categories
- `ReleaseNotes` → Controls release notes display
- `IconUri` → Controls module icon (if present)

Without the proper `PSData` nesting, these fields are ignored by the PowerShell Gallery, even though they exist in the manifest.

## Impact

- Users cannot easily navigate to the project repository
- License information is not readily accessible
- Module discoverability through tags may be reduced
- Professional appearance of the module page is diminished

## Next Steps for Version 0.1.1

### 1. Update Module Manifest
- Fix the `PrivateData` structure in `OTP.psd1`
- Increment `ModuleVersion` from '0.1.0' to '0.1.1'
- Update any date stamps if necessary

### 2. Test Changes Locally
```powershell
# Validate the updated manifest
Test-ModuleManifest -Path 'OTP.psd1'

# Check that PSData structure is correct
$manifest = Import-PowerShellDataFile -Path 'OTP.psd1'
$manifest.PrivateData.PSData
```

### 3. Rebuild and Republish
```powershell
# Publish the corrected version
Publish-Module -Name 'OTP' -Repository 'PSGallery' -NuGetApiKey $apiKey
```

### 4. Verify Fix
- Check the new version page on PowerShell Gallery
- Confirm that Project Site and License Info links appear in the Info section
- Validate that all metadata displays correctly

## Lesson Learned

PowerShell Gallery metadata must follow the exact structure expected by the gallery API. Even though the PowerShell engine itself may accept various structures, the gallery has specific requirements for `PrivateData.PSData` that must be followed for proper display and functionality.

This is a common mistake that affects module presentation and user experience, emphasizing the importance of validating gallery-specific requirements during the publishing process.

## Version Impact

- **Version 0.1.0**: Published with incorrect structure (immutable)
- **Version 0.1.1**: Will include the manifest fix (to be published)

Note: PowerShell Gallery versions are immutable - once published, a version cannot be updated or overwritten, requiring a version increment for any changes.
